- tkinter program that can turn a config file into an image
  - each line is one pixel; it has the hex colour
  - a blank line means to go down a line
  - a SKIP value means the pixel should be skipped
  - the ktinter program will use a for line in file block
    - and it will parse
    - and draw on the canvas
    - and provide a saving option that screenshots the canvas (?)
  - pixel size can be changed, but quality will be lost similar to picture enlargers
